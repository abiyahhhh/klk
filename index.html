            <img src="abby.jpeg" alt="About me">
            <p>I am Abegail E. Ramiro. I'm twenty years old and live in Burgos, Pangasinan. 
                I am currently a second-year BSIT student at Pangasinan State University in Urdaneta City. 
                I, like everyone else, am just simple. I'm a friendly person, thus I have a lot of friends. 
                Almost everyone assumed I was grouchy and silent at first, but when they met me, they realized 
                they had been misled because I am a pleasant and outgoing person. I have three siblings, with me being the 
                only female and the oldest. I absolutely enjoy dogs. My two canines' names are Max and Bella. 
                My dogs have played a crucial role in my life. Sleeping is occasionally my only interest. 
                I adore music and occasionally sing. There are moments when I want to dance but I'm not completely secure in my talents.</p>
